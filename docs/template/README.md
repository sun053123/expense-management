## How to Use This Template

1. **Copy the template directory** to your project folder
2. **Customize each file** according to your specific project needs
3. **Combine relevant sections** when creating your final prompt
4. **Test and iterate** based on the AI responses you receive

## Prompt Assembly Guidelines

When creating your final prompt, consider including:

1. **Core System Prompt** (always include)
2. **Relevant Knowledge Base** sections (based on task complexity)
3. **Specific Style Guidelines** (for code generation tasks)
4. **Tool Chain Strategy** (for complex multi-step tasks)
5. **Resource References** (when accessing external systems)
6. **Test Requirements** (for implementation tasks)
7. **Validation Criteria** (for quality assurance)

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with just the system prompt and add complexity as needed
2. **Be Specific**: Provide concrete examples rather than abstract descriptions
3. **Test Iteratively**: Refine the prompt based on actual AI responses
4. **Maintain Consistency**: Keep terminology and patterns consistent across files
5. **Update Regularly**: Keep the template current with project evolution

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Code Generation
Include: 01_system_prompt.txt + 03_coding_style_guide.txt

### Scenario 2: Complex Feature Implementation
Include: 01_system_prompt.txt + 02_knowledge_base.txt + 03_coding_style_guide.txt + 04_tool_chain_strategy.txt

### Scenario 3: Full Project Development
Include: All template files with project-specific customizations

## Maintenance

- Review and update templates quarterly
- Collect feedback from team members using the templates
- Document successful prompt patterns for reuse
- Keep examples current with latest project practices
